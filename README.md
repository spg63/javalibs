Simple collection of classes / functions that I frequently use when writing Java code. It's made my life easier, perhaps it can help make yours easier too.
There are also some testing functions in here that may or may not work properly.
This 'library' is not tested nearly as much as cpplibs, nor is it optimized.
    - Java already has so many utilities out there, this isn't nearly as necessary
    as it is in C++.
